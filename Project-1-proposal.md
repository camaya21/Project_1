### Your chosen game 
> Brief 2-3 sentence description of your game
I chose a trivia game where there will be some american history questions, and each question will have a set of answers. if the player can get through some questions and answer correctly, then they win, if not they lose. 
### Basic User stories
-User opens up game and the first thing they see is a screen that says Trivia Fun - Start Play
-User picks start play and the first questions pops up.
-on the screen, User sees a timer that gives each question 30 seconds
-User picks answer and it is correct so answer lights up green
-Next question pops up and user picks a wrong answer, the wrong answer lights up red
-Next question pops up, user took too long to answer, 30 seconds  are up and question answers wrong
-User has gone through a few questions and gets to the end. They get a score out of 10, if more that 5 questions were correct they win. If less than 5 questions were correct then they lose.
-if User wins, User sees a party screen that says YOU WIN
-if User loses, user sees a screen that says YOU LOSE
