Game Title: Are you smarter than a fifth grader?
- The game is a set of 10 questions that a 5th grader would know the answers to. Test your knwoledge and see if you're smarter than 5th grader!
- If your answer is correct, then you'll see a correct message at the bottom of the question. It shows up for 1.5 seconds then goes away and takes you to the next question.
- The same thing happens with a wrong answer. You only get one try at each question!
- You have 20 seconds on the timer to answer each question. If time runs out, you'll automatically get taken to the next question.
- If your score is greater than 5 then you are smarter than 5th grader! If your score is less than 5, then you are not smarter than a 5th grader! The goal is to prove your knowledge!
